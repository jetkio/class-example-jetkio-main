# Compiler Construction with Flex and Bison


The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with two powerful tools used in compiler generation: **flex** and **bison**.

You are provided with the source files for a calculator application. The files include:

| File       | Description                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `calc.l`   | Contains the regular expression rules        |
| `calc.y`   | Contains the grammar rules                   |
| `calc.h`   | Contains a data structure used by calculator |
| `makefile` | Contains the make commands to build the app  |

## Setup Instructions

1. Examine files generated by the parser and the tokenizer generators  
   - Use the commands discussed in the notes
   - This step is for your practice

2. Build the Application  
   - Use the following command to compile the calculator:

    ```bash
    [dev@linux2] make
    ```

3. Run the Application  
   - After building, run the executable calc that is created in the folder:
   - At the prompt `>>` , you can enter:
      - any arithmetic expression. 
      - Use `.` to exit. 
      - Use `?` for help.

    ```bash
    [dev@linux2] ./calc  
    >> 3 + 4  
    7 
    >> ?
      Enter an expression in infix notation followed by a newline.
      Operators include +, -, *, /, and =.
      You can assign a variable using the =
      operator. Type . to exit. 
    >> .  

    [dev@linux2]
    ```

    

## Modification Task

You are required to modify the calculator application to support the following logical operators. 
- ***`All operators must have left associativity.`***

| Operator | Meaning       | Precedence                              | Description                                                                                   |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `&`      | Logical AND    | Lowest                                   | This is equivalent to && in C language. It is a binary operator. If it evaluates to true, it returns 1 and if evaluates to false it returns 0.                       |
| `\|`      | Logical OR     | Same as `&`                              | This is equivalent to \|\| in C language. It is a binary operator. If it evaluates to true, it returns 1 and if evaluates to false it returns 0.     |
| `==`     | Equal | Higher than & and \|, lower than > and < | It is a binary operator. If both sides are of equal values, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.|
| `>`      | Greater than   | Highest                                  | It is a binary operator. If the left operand has a greater value than the right operand, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.          |
| `<`      | Less than      | Same as `>`                              | It is a binary operator. If the left operand has a greater value than the right operand, it returns 0, otherwise it returns 1.|

## Sample Test Session
```
   >> a = 5  
   >> b = 8  
   >> a > b  
   0  
   >> a < b & a < b  
   1  
   >> a == 5 & 3 > 4 | a > 5  
   0
```

## Hints

- You do not need to modify the grammar rules to implement associativity and precedence.
- Use the declaration section of calc.y to define the precedence and associativity of your logical operators.
- Follow the examples and comments already present in calc.y.
- Logical AND (&) should have higher precedence than assignment (=).
- Greater than (>) should have lower precedence than + and -.

## Submission

You submit this assignment by committing and pushing to the repo
  - I provided a `hw5` ***folder***: 
    - you need to rename it `hw5_<firstname_lastname>_<section##>`
    - For instance: `hw5_zelalem_yalew_03`
    - ***`This is the only way to identify who you are`***
  - You must also update the header comment in your generator codes. 

    ```bash
    /*
    File:    [FILENAME].l or .y
    Author:  [YOUR NAME]
    Date:    [THE DATE]
    Section: [YOUR SECTION NUMBER]
